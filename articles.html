                              <p> Late last year, I accidentally came across a video clip that arouses my interest to 
                                        utter what is on my mind. In the clip, a man was standing on a dry ground, 
                                        visibly with no sign of dampness; parched as if the soil has been baked. 
                                        Spruced up he appeared, like a TV programme anchor and he said: 
                                        'ladies and gentlemen welcome to Amazon Desert .' I raised eye brows, 
                                        I only know Amazon Forest, the one in Brazil. It was after the end of the 
                                        clip that I perceived the idea. It was an irony which meant that as far as
                                         human activities that are taking place right now in Amazon rain forest will 
                                         continue, one day the forest will turn to desert.</p>
                              <p>There are many human activities taking place globally that are posing great danger to the 
                                        sustainability of our planet. The one that has been putting more weight on my 
                                        conscience is deforestation. By definition, deforestation is the act of clearing 
                                        stand trees where the land is thereafter converted to a non-forest use. Trees and 
                                        any other plantations play vital roles in making our environment habitable, 
                                        but to my surprise here in Azare people tend to neglect the fact. I don't know whether 
                                        the actors are doing it consciously or unconsciously. Recall that, few years back, 
                                        towards every entryway of Azare metropolis there was beautiful forest of 'Neem Trees'. 
                                        These trees were planted many years back by those who have better plan for the future. 
                                        Unfortunately these forest are now destroyed by some people due to their selfish interests. 
                                        Even though I know some parts of the forests were chopped off by road construction companies
                                        whom they supposed to replace them. Replacing these trees will even extend the 
                                        life span of the roads if at all they care; because trees reduce erosion. 
                                        My question here is where are the authorities that are mandated to take good care of these trees? 
                                        Sorry! I was told by somebody that the authorities also take part in this atrocity 
                                        (of indiscriminate cutting of trees). I am using this medium to call the attention of 
                                        relevant stakeholders to please bring back our trees/'reforestate' our Azare before it become 
                                        'Azare Desert' instead of Azare Town. More so, I am soliciting for the cooperation of all the good 
                                        people of Azare town to embark on planting more trees in order to make our environment habitable.</p>
                              <p>Global warming is existent, whether we like it or not. Some plants, animals and insects are moving toward 
                                        extinction but people don't know. We don't want to be curious over our changing environment 
                                        year in year out. For instance, Fire flies are no where to be found. I can remember when we were 
                                        kids we used to catch them at night during raining season. Researches proven that extinction of a 
                                        single insect can affect ecosystem; 'Kai' even mosquito, because bats feed on them. 
                                        One day in the middle of last year I was in the market to buy Tamarind 'Tsamiya', 
                                        I barely got handful for N100. I ask the vendor, why too cost and scarce? He answered me 
                                        that most of its trees had been cut down by people for fire wood. If a single person in a 
                                        county of New Jersey can embark on research on why the number of squirrels devastating 
                                        his farm land are reducing, why shouldn't our intellectuals embark on a research on why cocoyam 
                                        'Gwaza' is nowadays not all that bumper. You will believe me if you go to the market and 
                                        investigate. There are so many, and I mean so many examples of how things around us 
                                        are moving toward extinction due to global warming but people don't give the damn. 
                                        Better we wake up from slumber and face the reality. Let's join hands together to make our 
                                        environment GREEN.</p>
